In this project we will be looking at the implementation and practical application of Treaps. It reads from a file data.txt and the first entry is the number os total entries.
    It has 5 functions :
    insert 
    search 
    delete
    meld
    inoreder traversal
    
Application_treaps_code: 
    Unlike normal treap it uses user input value(number of items in inventory) as the priority and uses min_heapify instead of the standard maxheapify.
    also it creates binary search tree with respect to strings (alphabetically sorted)
